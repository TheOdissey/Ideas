This repo contains file with the five startup idea briefs that each team member is supposed to come up with. Each brief shortly describes the problem it is trying to solve, the way it could solve it, who wants it, who is doing it already, how to get paid for it, and a list of technologies that could be required other than the usual web development technologies.
