I believe that in the foreseeable future the internet will 
enter a phase that will put more emphasis on local / neighbor to neighbor interaction.
What I mean is that people would rather explore there local community to a greater extent, 
rather than trying to connect with someone overseas/in another state and so forth.

Now the ideas:

1. Talent factory
A hub where you can post/explore videos of your talent. Different from Youtube? Yes, more local exposure. People you see
in videos are people you might actually be able to see on campus. Possibly the site can have a lottery structure, where
a video gets featured on the front page of the site. The site has a dual nature. It can be a source of talent discovery
and a source of entertainment
2. Foot traffic
Monitor berkeley foot traffic. For some reason I have an instinctive feelng this could be a really cool project to work
on. I want to hear your guys' opinions on where we can take it.
3. Berkeley share
Share anything within Berkeley campus. Bikes, books, power tools. Restriction to Berkeley campus provides a layer 
of security, which is otherwise hard to achieve in a non-institutional community.
4. Berkeley skill locator/trading
Ask your fellow berkeley students for help in whatever you want. In return you can provide help
with your skillset. Based on location, skill set, gender?
5. Berkeley policy
Propose an improvement on berkeley campus. If location is applicable, drop a pin on the map.
