The following are the boundaries are set for myself while coming up with ideas.
Why did I do that? I believe that in the foreseeable future the internet will 
enter a phase that will put more emphasis on local / neighbor to neighbor interaction.
What I mean is that people would rather explore there local community to a greater extent, 
rather than trying to connect with someone overseas/in another state and so forth.

1. Something that touches me personally
2. Berkeley restricted
3. Money involved

Now to the ideas:

1. Talent factory
A hub where you can post/explore videos of your talent. Different from Youtube? Yes, more local exposure.
2. Foot traffic
Interesting concept. Have not thought through monetization yet.
2. Berkeley laughs
9gag for berkeley students. More local exposure again. 
3. Berkeley share
Share machinery within Berkeley campus. Bikes, ...
4. Berkeley cry for help (hw that is) / Skill locator/trading
Ask your fellow berkeley students for help. Based on location, skill set, gender?
